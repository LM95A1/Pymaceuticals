# Pymaceuticals
*Matplotlib Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 5*

This repository contains the necessary script in a Jupyter Notebook as requested for the Matplotlib Challenge. The notebook also includes the short analysis of the data.

## Dependencies
---

This Jupyter Notebook was handcrafted in Visual Studio Code and tested in Python 3.11.3 by opening the terminal within the directory containing the notebook and running the following command:

```
jupyter notebook 'Pymaceuticals.ipynb'
```

Dependencies are included in the notebook.

## Credits
---
Most of the information used to complete this assignment was found in the Matplotlib documentation, as I admittedly had some trouble figuring out how to calculate some of the statistics. Notes from last week's modules were also helpful in completing this assignment.

Stack Overflow was not used for this, but a hell of a lot of Google sure was.

Coding Soundtrack for this week was Fit for a King's album, [The Hell We Create](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCslpjrb7cYgDC-CwSrFs6LapOjmtmxSL).
